  - A list of articles (headline, image, description if present, date)
  - A “detailed” view for each article (headline, image, date, content, source)
  - Articles in the list must link to a detailed article view within your app (linking to the source website does not fulfill this requirement)
  - Some sort of search, filter, OR sort
